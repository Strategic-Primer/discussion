# Strategic Primer discussion forum

[This repository's
issues](https://github.com/Strategic-Primer/discussion/issues) are intended to
be a place for public discussion of mechanics, statistics, procedures, etc.,
associated with [Strategic Primer](https://strategicprimer.wordpress.com).

Many discussions should take place on [the
list](https://groups.io/g/strategicprimer) instead, but for some this format is
clearly better, and some participants may prefer this format.

Public text describing the game and the results of such discussions may
eventually be added to the repository itself.
